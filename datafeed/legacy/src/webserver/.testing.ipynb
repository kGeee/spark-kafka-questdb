Automation 360                provides both On-Premises and Cloud deployment                options and is the first platform that provides RPA-as-a-Service as an automation                solution. It enables users to automate applications across different infrastructures                and industries such as banking, telecommunications, and business process outsourcing                (BPO) organizations.Automation 360 provides capabilities such as the following:An intuitive interface to create a bot and design business                        process automation workflows.Support for multiple operating systems including Windows, Linux, and                        MacOS.Different views of bot to facilitate collaboration: flow view                        for business users, list view for developers, and dual view for                        collaboration.Recorder that works across various platforms such as Microsoft Windows,                        Citrix, Web, and SAP.Advanced variables capabilities and support for JavaScript, Python, and VBScript.A flexible architecture that enables you to add new packages.The platform also includes attended automation and plug-ins that enable business                users to automate tasks from within their business applications such as Microsoft                Excel and Salesforce. This capability makes automation of front-office processes                easier, faster, and more cost-efficient.Automation 360 is available globally and in 10 languages, including                English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish,                Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.Automation 360 componentsAutomation Co-Pilot for Business Users (Automation Co-Pilot)Automation Co-Pilot is an easy-to-use interface that enables                        business users to collaborate with bots. Users can start                        process automations, provide feedback to bots to resume                        processes, and escalate requests to additional users for downstream                        processing. Automation Co-Pilot enables the enterprise to unlock                        new automation opportunities between humans and bots that RPA                        could not previously address.Automation Co-Pilot for Business Users (previously named AARI)Automation Workspace(formerly known as RPA Workspace) A web-based workspace that                  provides the tools and capabilities to create, upload, and deploy bots to automate repetitive tasks and processes. It                  includes the following: Control RoomBot RunnerBot editorBot CreatorCredential VaultAutomation Workspace provides the following capabilities:Enables users to manage, schedule, and execute botsEnables user management through Active Directory role mappingEnables users to manage large number of Work Items                                through workload managementProcess DiscoveryAn intelligent business solution that delivers a real-time, data-driven map                        of your business to help you uncover transformational process insights                        across all applications, through each department, and for every single task.                            Process Discovery follows the human instead of process                        logs by using advanced computer vision, machine learning, and artificial                        intelligence to capture every step in every process across every system. It                        requires zero integration, is universally compatible, and provides the                        privacy and security of an on-premises solution.Privacy Enhanced GatewayUsing Privacy Enhanced Gateway (PEG), enterprises can confidently execute on                        their strategic business initiatives by filtering their sensitive data in a                        secure and scalable manner. PEG works by redacting sensitive data that has                        been obtained on customer's machines within their own network before                        forwarding the data to the Process Discovery cloud for                        analysis. As all traffic from the agents goes through PEG before leaving the                        customer's perimeter, PEG removes personally identifiable information (PII)                        and sensitive data.Getting started with Privacy Enhanced GatewayDiscovery BotAn intelligent business solution for enterprise businesses that provides                        capabilities for end users to discover opportunities for automation using                        process discovery. Discovery Bot focuses on process                        automation by capturing document processes, identifying opportunities from                        business centric processes, and prioritizing opportunities based on ROI, and                        create bots automatically. Discovery Bot                        aligns business workers to uncover automation opportunities that can                        optimize the return on your RPA investment. Process discovery by using Discovery BotIQ BotAn intelligent document processing solution that can read and process                        various complex documents and emails.

scale. Automation 360 is        an industry-leading RPA and digital workforce platform that combines an easy-to-use user        interface with enterprise-class reliability and the security to enable real-time        self-automation.OverviewAutomation 360 is an industry-leading RPA and digital workforce                platform that combines an easy-to-use user interface with enterprise-class                reliability and the security to enable real-time self-automation. It delivers a                browser-based, intuitive experience for business users to quickly automate tasks and                tools for developers to build process automation. Automation 360                provides both On-Premises and Cloud deployment                options and is the first platform that provides RPA-as-a-Service as an automation                solution. It enables users to automate applications across different infrastructures                and industries such as banking, telecommunications, and business process outsourcing                (BPO) organizations.Automation 360 provides capabilities such as the following:An intuitive interface to create a bot and design business                        process automation workflows.Support for multiple operating systems including Windows, Linux, and                        MacOS.Different views of bot to facilitate collaboration: flow view                        for business users, list view for developers, and dual view for                        collaboration.Recorder that works across various platforms such as Microsoft Windows,                        Citrix, Web, and SAP.Advanced variables capabilities and support for JavaScript, Python, and VBScript.A flexible architecture that enables you to add new packages.The platform also includes attended automation and plug-ins that enable business                users to automate tasks from within their business applications such as Microsoft                Excel and Salesforce. This capability makes automation of front-office processes                easier, faster, and more cost-efficient.Automation 360 is available globally and in 10 languages, including                English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish,                Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.Automation 360 componentsAutomation Co-Pilot for Business Users (Automation Co-Pilot)Automation Co-Pilot is an easy-to-use interface that enables                        business users to collaborate with bots. Users can start                        process automations, provide feedback to bots to resume                        processes, and escalate requests to additional users for downstream                        processing. Automation Co-Pilot enables the enterprise to unlock                        new automation opportunities between humans and bots that RPA                        could not previously address.Automation Co-Pilot for Business Users (previously named AARI)Automation Workspace(formerly known as RPA Workspace) A web-based workspace that                  provides the tools and capabilities to create, upload, and deploy bots to automate repetitive tasks and processes. It                  includes the following: Control RoomBot RunnerBot editorBot CreatorCredential VaultAutomation Workspace provides the following capabilities:Enables users to manage, schedule, and execute botsEnables user management through Active Directory role mappingEnables users to manage large number of Work Items                                through workload managementProcess DiscoveryAn intelligent business solution that delivers a real-time, data-driven map                        of your business to help you uncover transformational process insights                        across all applications, through each department, and for every single task.                            Process Discovery follows the human instead of process                        logs by using advanced computer vision, machine learning, and artificial                        intelligence to capture every step in every process across every system. It                        requires zero integration, is universally compatible, and provides the                        privacy and security of an on-premises solution.Privacy Enhanced GatewayUsing Privacy Enhanced Gateway (PEG), enterprises can confidently execute on                        their strategic business initiatives by filtering their sensitive data in a                        secure and scalable manner. PEG works by redacting sensitive data that has                        been obtained on customer's machines within their own network before                        forwarding the data to the Process Discovery cloud for                        analysis. As all traffic from the agents goes through PEG before leaving the                        customer's perimeter, PEG removes personally identifiable information (PII)                        and sensitive data.Getting started with Privacy Enhanced GatewayDiscovery BotAn intelligent business solution for enterprise businesses that provides                        capabilities for end users to discover opportunities for automation using                        process discovery. Discovery Bot focuses on process                        automation by capturing document processes, identifying opportunities from                        business centric processes, and prioritizing opportunities based on ROI, and                        create bots automatically. Discovery Bot                        aligns business workers to uncover automation opportunities that can                        optimize the return on your RPA investment.
